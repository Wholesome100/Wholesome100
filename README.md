## Domains
### Web Development
I have made a couple of sites using Sveltekit and Next.js, with Vercel being the main hosting service that I used. Firebase was used on the backend to store data in a NoSQL manner, and an example Sveltekit site I've made can be seen with Wioleta of the Flowers in the authorship section.

### Game Development
I have made a couple games under the Salmonware banner with my partner [nick-onetap](https://github.com/nick-onetap). They are:
1. [Raincatcher](https://salmonware.itch.io/raincatcher): A comfy game about catching frogs in the rain
2. [Yumpers](https://salmonware.itch.io/yumpers): A 3D platformer with a techno-flair

Give them a try!

## Authorship
Outside of coding, I have done narrative writing in a couple of online spaces:
- [Wioleta of the Flowers](https://www.wioletaoftheflowers.com/) is a ~40 thousand word novel that I wrote back in 2023, which centers around the titular character, Wioleta, as she reckons with a dire purpose.
- [Tales of the Heartland](https://www.wattpad.com/story/364388129-tales-of-the-heartland) is an anthology of stories that I wrote back in 2022, which take place in same universe, at different times.

While I have pride in both works, they have not been professionally edited, and rewrites are due for some story components.
Additionally, Tales of the Heartland is hosted on Wattpad, which may hinder the viewing experince on mobile.
Part of the reason I made a site for Wioleta's story was due to the pushy nature of Wattpad's ads, and a general dislike for the overall site's content quality.
